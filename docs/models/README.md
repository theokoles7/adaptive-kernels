## Normal-CNN (Custom)

The custom convolutional neural network developed for this project is a simple, 4-layer classifier.

## ResNet-18

A [residual neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network) (also referred to as a residual network or ResNet) is a deep learning architecture in which the layers learn residual functions with reference to the layer inputs. It was developed in 2015 for image recognition, and won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) of that year.

## VGG-16

[VGG-16](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/vgg-16) refers to a convolutional neural network architecture developed by Simonyan et al. It consists of 13 convolution layers and three fully connected layers, following the ReLU tradition established by AlexNet.
